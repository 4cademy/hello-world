# hello-world

Hey Humans! (And AI... maybe)

I'm Marcel, just registered on GitHub due to my "Technology of Information Systems" studies. I hope I'll have a great time on here. ^^


@FutureMarcel: When you read this, you will hopefully be a better programmer now. xD

Marcel <16th December 2023>: I just stumbled across this and had to smile. My programming and engineering skills have come a long way since then. Looking forward to stumbling across this again in the future.

@FutureMarcel: I hope you got your exchange spot in Switzerland and had a good time during your last few semesters.

<br>

Marcel <16th October 2024>: Why wish seems to have worked. I am currently on exchange at EPFL in Switzerland and I gotta say this is the most amazing semester I ever had. Studies are great and omg I love this landscape!

@FutureMarcel: Please have figured out how to come back to Switzerland or stay here permanently.
