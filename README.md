Hey Humans! (And AI... maybe)

I'm Marcel, just registered on GitHub due to my "Technology of information systems" studies. Hope I'll have a great time on here. ^^


@FutureMarcel: When you read this, you are hopefully a better programmer now. xD

Marcel <16th December 2023>: I just stumbled across this and had to smile. My programming and engineering skills have come a long way since then. Looking forward to stumbling across this again in the future.
@FutureMarcel: I hope you got your exchange spot in Switzerland and had a good time during your last few semesters.
